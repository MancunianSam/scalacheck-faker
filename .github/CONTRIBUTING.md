# Contributing

Hello there! It seems that you are interested in contributing to one of my personal
project offerings. That is fantastic news! Thank you for taking the time out of your 
day to help one of my projects.

I have a few simple but important rules for accepting contributions:

- Don't be a jerk
- Adhere to the existing code style

That's it! Thanks for reading.
